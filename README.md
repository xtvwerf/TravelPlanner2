**Title:** My Android Mobile app is called Vacation Planner, and helps people plan and keep track of upcoming vacations. The user can create, edit, and delete both vacations and excursions for the associated vacations. They can set notifications for vacation and excursion dates and share vacation information via the communication method of their choice.

**Purpose:** I learned how to take an app from an idea to a finished product, keeping the functionality and user experience as the main focus. Along the way, using Java to code the logic for the app and Android Studio views with XML to layout and style the app.

**How to use the app:**
1. Upon entering the application, you will be greeted by the home screen. Press the green “Enter” button to start.
2. You will now be on the main Vacation List page. Here you will see an overview of the vacation titles you have saved. To create a new one, click the green “+” button at the bottom right.
3. This is the vacation add/edit page, and you can also add, view, and edit excursions for the associated vacation. You need to create a vacation before you can create an excursion. Enter the vacation information in the top portion. If you would like to be notified about vacation start and end dates, check the “Notify Me” checkbox. Once finished adding vacation information, click the 3 vertical dots at the top right, then “Save Vacation”. This will save the vacation to the database based on the information you provided. You can go back into the vacation and edit details as needed. Just make sure to press the “Save Vacation” button every time.
4. You will be brought back to the Vacation List page - from here, click back into the vacation you just created. Once in the vacation details page, click the green “+” button at the bottom right to create an Excursion. Now on the excursion edit/add screen, enter the information for your desired excursion and select the associated vacation. **NOTE:** The excursion date must be within the associated vacation start and end dates. Check the “Notify Me” checkbox if you would like to be notified of the excursion on the excursion date. Once finished, press the 3 vertical dots at the top right, then “Save Excursion”. You can go back into the excursion and edit details as needed. Just make sure to press the “Save Excursion” button every time.
5. You will be brought back to the Vacation details page, and you can now see the excursion you just added under “Excursions”. If you would like to share the Vacation details with someone, you can click the 3 vertical dots again, and press the “Share Details” button. A sharing dialog will pop up - select the method in which you want to share the vacation information. Once finished sharing, make your way back to the app. Repeat steps 2-5 to create, edit, and share as many vacations and excursions as you wish.
6. If you need to delete an excursion, make your way to the excursion you want to delete, press the 3 vertical dots, then “Delete Excursion”.
7. If you need to delete a vacation, make your way to the vacation you want to delete, press the 3 vertical dots, then “Delete Vacation”. **NOTE:** You cannot delete a vacation that has excursions associated with it. You either need to re-associate the excursions with a different vacation, or delete the excursions, then delete the vacation.

**Android Version:** The signed APK is deployed for Android version 8.
